The files related to breadth first (BFS) and depth first (DFS) search algorithms in python requires
additional files to be used for the algorithm to run. These are also added to the repo.
There is another file that uses the BFS search to make sub graphs containing certain number of nodes.
It also contains a file that maps arbitrary node ids from an edge list file to continuous node ids starting from 0. This works with edge weights as well,
without changing the edge weights column in the file.
