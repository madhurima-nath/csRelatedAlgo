## Why study data structures?
A program is comprised of **data** and **algorithms**. Algorithms tell us how the data will be transformed. **Adding structure to data can make algorithms simpler, easier to maintain, and often faster.**


Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to other elements
that came before or after it. Examples include stacks, queues, dequeues, lists.

Not being a CS student, needed to learn about basic data structures.
This repo contains some basic python codes I came up with while
learning data structures.
