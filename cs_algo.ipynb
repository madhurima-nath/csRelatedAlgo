However, insertion sort provides several advantages:\n- it is simple to implement\n- efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms\n- adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is $O(kn)$ when each element in the input is no more than k places away from its sorted position\n- stable, i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys\n- in-place, i.e., only requires a constant amount $O(1)$ of additional memory space\n- online, i.e., can sort a list as it receives it\n\nInsertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list.

It is an improved selection sort: similar to slection sort algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.\nThe heapsort algorithm can be divided into two parts.\n\ni. a heap is built out of the data. The heap is often placed in an array with the layout of a complete binary tree. The complete binary tree maps the binary tree structure into the array indices; each array index represents a node; the index of the node's parent, left child branch, or right child branch are simple expressions. For a zero-based array, the root node is stored at index 0; if $i$ is the index of the current node, then\n\n  iParent(i)     = $floor((i-1) / 2)$ where $floor$ functions map a real number to the smallest leading integer.\n  \n  iLeftChild(i)  = $2*i + 1$\n  \n  iRightChild(i) = $2*i + 2$\n  \nii. a sorted array is created by repeatedly removing the largest element from the heap (the root of the heap), and inserting it into the array. The heap is updated after each removal to maintain the heap property. Once all objects have been removed from the heap, the result is a sorted array.\n\nHeapsort can be performed in place. The array can be split into two parts, the sorted array and the heap. The storage of heaps as arrays is diagrammed here. The heap's invariant is preserved after each extraction, so the only cost is that of extraction.\n\n\n#### Algorithm\nThe heap sort algorithm involves preparing the list by first turning it into a max heap. The algorithm then repeatedly swaps the first value of the list with the last value, decreasing the range of values considered in the heap operation by one, and sifting the new first value into its position in the heap. This repeats until the range of considered values is one value in length.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n- Call the buildMaxHeap() function on the list. Also referred to as heapify(), this builds a heap from a list in O(n) operations.\n- Swap the first element of the list with the final element. Decrease the considered range of the list by one.\n- Call the siftDown() function on the list to sift the new first element to its appropriate index in the heap.\n- Go to step (2) unless the considered range of the list is one element.\n\n\n#### Big-Oh Notation:\nThe buildMaxHeap() operation is run once, and is $O(n)$ in performance. The siftDown() function is $O(log n)$, and is called $n$ times. Therefore, the performance of this algorithm is $O(n + n log n) = O(n log n)$.\n- Time: Worst $O(n log n)$, Best $O(n log n)$ distinct keys, $O(n)$ equal keys, Average $O(n log n)$\n- Space: Worst $O(n)$ total, $O(1)$ auxiliary"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def heapify(arr, n, i):\n    largest = i\n    l = 2*i + 1\n    r = 2*i + 2\n    \n    if l < n and arr[i] < arr[l]:\n        largest = l\n    \n    if r < n and arr[largest] < arr[r]:\n        largest = r\n        \n    if largest != i: \n        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]     # swap \n        \n        heapify(arr, n, largest)\n        \n        \ndef heap_sort(arr): \n    n = len(arr) \n  \n    # Build a maxheap. \n    for i in range(n, -1, -1): \n        heapify(arr, n, i) \n  \n    # One by one extract elements \n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1): \n        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i] # swap \n        heapify(arr, i, 0) ","execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"a = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7] \nheap_sort(a)\nprint(a)","execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"[5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13]\n"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <font color = blue > Quick Sort </font>\nQuicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a \"less-than\" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. In efficient implementations it is not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved. Quicksort can operate in-place on an array, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting. It is very similar to selection sort, except that it does not always choose worst-case partition.\n\nQuicksort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays. The steps are:\n\n1. Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array.\n2. Partitioning: reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.\n3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.\nThe base case of the recursion is arrays of size zero or one, which are in order by definition, so they never need to be sorted.\n\nThe pivot selection and partitioning steps can be done in several different ways; the choice of specific implementation schemes greatly affects the algorithm's performance.\n\n\n#### Big-Oh Notation:\nThe partitioning step performs $O(n)$ work in $O(log n)$ time and requires $O(n)$ additional scratch space. After the array has been partitioned, the two partitions can be sorted recursively in parallel.

Print the value of the next data element by assgining the pointer of the next node to the current data element.\n\n(Source: <a href = 'https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_linked_lists.htm'> Python-tutorials</a>)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"class Node:\n    def __init__(self, dataval=None):\n        self.dataval = dataval\n        self.nextval = None\n\nclass SLinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.headval = None\n        \n    #needs work   \n    #def append_llist(self, dataval):\n    #function to append items to single linked list\n    \n        #if self.headval is None:\n            #self.headval = Node(dataval)\n        #else:\n            #self.headval.nextval = Node(dataval)\n        \n        \n    def printlist(self):\n        #function to traverse/print the items of linked list\n        \n        print_val = self.headval\n        while print_val is not None:\n            print(print_val.dataval)\n            print_val = print_val.nextval","execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"llist = SLinkedList()\nllist.headval = Node('Mon')\ne2 = Node('Tue')\ne3 = Node('Wed')\nllist.headval.nextval = e2\ne2.nextval = e3\n\nprint(llist.headval.dataval)\nprint(e2.dataval)","execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Mon\nTue\n"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Traversing through the linked list and printing out the contents of the list"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def print_list(llist):\n    print_val = llist.headval\n    while print_val is not None:\n        print(print_val.dataval)\n        print_val = print_val.nextval","execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print_list(llist)","execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Mon\nTue\nWed\n"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Inserting a new data point in a linked list. \nThree different situations:\n- if the position is 0, i.e., the head of the linked list is to be replaced by the new value (almost similar to shifting the list)\n- if the position is at the end of the linked list, i.e., extending the existing linked list\n- insert in between two nodes of the linked list\n\nIn all these cases, have to careful to check for null values in the linked list."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def insertnodeatposition(position, data):\n\n    '''this function takes as input the position \n    at which the new number/data is to be inserted\n    and the new number/data'''\n    \n    if llist.headval is None:\n        return 'the node is absent'\n    \n    if position == 0:\n        new_node = Node(data)\n        new_node.nextval = llist.headval\n        llist.headval = new_node\n        return print_list(llist)\n\n    new_node = Node(data)\n    new_node.nextval = llist.headval.nextval.nextval\n    llist.headval.nextval.nextval = new_node\n    return print_list(llist)\n     ","execution_count":29,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"insertnodeatposition(0, 'Thurs')\ninsertnodeatposition(2, 'Sat')","execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"Thurs\nThurs\nThurs\nMon\nTue\nWed\nThurs\nThurs\nSat\nThurs\nMon\nTue\nWed\n"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"llist = SLinkedList()\nllist.headval = Node(1)\ne2, e3, e4 = Node(2), Node(3), Node(4)\nllist.headval.nextval = e2\ne2.nextval = e3\ne3.nextval = e4\nprint_list(llist)","execution_count":31,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"1\n2\n3\n4\n"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"insertnodeatposition(2, 5)","execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"1\n2\n5\n3\n4\n"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Removing an item from the linked list"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def removenode(data):\n    \n    temp = llist.headval \n    \n    if temp is not None:\n        if temp.dataval == data:\n            #
